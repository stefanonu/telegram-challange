# ðŸ’³ Mini Payment-Link Challenge

Welcome ðŸ‘‹  
This repo contains a deliberately **buggy** in-memory implementation of a payment-link
service (`service.py`) plus a small test-suite (`tests`).  
**All tests are red on purpose.** Your task is to make them green without
changing the test-code.

## ðŸ“œ Background

A payment link can move through these states:

CREATED â”€â”€â–º PAID â”€â”€â–º REFUNDED

â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â–º EXPIRED (if TTL lapses before payment)
